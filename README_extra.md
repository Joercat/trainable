## Cron / Keepalive
To prevent Render from idling, use cron-job.org (or similar) to ping the `/api/keepalive` endpoint every 10-15 minutes.
Example cron-job.org ping: https://<your-service>.onrender.com/api/keepalive

## Environment Variables
- ADMIN_USER (required) — admin username
- ADMIN_PASS (required) — admin password
- ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET (required) — Flask session secret
- DB_URL (optional) — if you wish to use Postgres, set this and the app will connect instead of SQLite
- S3_BUCKET, S3_KEY, S3_SECRET (optional) — enable S3 archival for backups

## Notes
- Optional heavy features such as sentence-transformers, faiss, and transformers are documented in `requirements-optional.txt` and must be installed manually.
- The included n-gram model is intentionally small and CPU-friendly. For better quality, you can add a quantized transformer to `models/` and enable it in the code.
